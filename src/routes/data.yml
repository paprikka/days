        I grew up in a tiny (700 souls) community in the mountains of southern Poland. 
        
        The place is called Kamionna, which means the *town of stones* in Polish. Ironically, the most common occupation (besides, unfortunately, alchoholism) is carpentry. Even the light on the altar of our church is made of wood.
        
        The region is known as the Island Mountains. It's an apt name, since once they were an archipelago. 

        And you can still see that! In the morning the valleys are covered with myst, like a white fluffy sea, revealing only the tops of the mountains.
