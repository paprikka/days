      I grew up in a tiny community (700 souls) in the mountains of southern Poland. 

      The place is called Kamionna, which means the *town of stones* in Polish. Ironically, the most common occupation (besides, unfortunately, alcoholism) is carpentry. Even the sculpted rays of light on the altar of our church are carved in wood.

      The region is known as the Island Mountains. It's an apt name, since they used to be an archipelago. 

      And you can still see that! In the morning the valleys are covered with mist, like a fluffy white sea, with only the tops of the mountains showing.

      She never had any grey hair or wrinkles. The only time I saw her not smiling was during the weeks before she passed away.
